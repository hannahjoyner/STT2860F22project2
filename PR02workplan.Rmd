**Work Plan/Assignments**

We will all work on the same parts of the project together. We will not split it up. This way we will collaborate on all parts of the project to ensure quality work. 

**Completion Timeline**

Our plan is to complete our project in class like our last project. We are following the same timeline and method to complete project 2 and if we need we will communicate on how to work on certain sections outside of class.

**Communication Plan**

We have each others phone numbers and we are prepared to group text to collaborate if need be; however, we plan to do most of our communicating in class face to face.
